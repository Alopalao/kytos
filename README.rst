Kytos - kyco
============

|Openflow| |Tag| |Release| |Tests| |License|

*Kyco* is the main component of Kytos Project. Kytos Controller (Kyco)
uses *python-openflow* library to parse low level OpenFlow messages.

This code is part of *Kytos* project and was developed to be used with
*Kytos* controller.

Main Highlights
---------------

Speed focused
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We keep the word *performance* in mind since the beginning of the
development. Also, as computer scientists, we will always try to get the
best performance by using the most suitable algorithms.

Some of our developers participated in several demonstrations involving
tests with high-speed networks (~1 terabit/s), some even involving data
transfers from/to CERN.

Always updated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To avoid code repetition this project utilizes an incremental
architecture.

This means that the first version (1.0.0 = v0x01) was coded from the
full OpenFlow 1.0.2 Protocol. The 1.1 version (v0x02) imports the 1.0
version and then do the necessary changes to make it compatible with the
OpenFlow 1.1.0 Protocol, and the next version follows the same logic.

Using incremental code makes the implementation of new versions of
OpenFlow protocol faster. Our main goal is to follow the specifications
since the very beginning.

Easy to learn
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python is an easy language to learn and we aim at writing code in a
"pythonic way". We also provide a well documented API. Thus, learning to
make your controller using this library is a trivial task.

Born to be free
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenFlow was born with a simple idea: make your network more vendor
agnostic and we like that!

We are advocates and supporters of free software and we believe that the
more eyes observe the code, the better it will be. This project can
receive support from many vendors, but will never follow a particular
vendor direction.

*python-openflow* will always be free software.
